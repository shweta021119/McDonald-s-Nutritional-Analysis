# McDonald-s-Nutritional-Analysis

Here we are doing Nutritional Analysis of nutritional content of the menu items available at McDonald's outlets.
This analysis will provide valuable insights into the calorie count and nutrition facts of various menu items, so that customers can make informed decisions about their food choices, 
helping them select options that align with their dietary preferences, health goals, and nutritional needs.

Using Pandas and Seaborn, we are analysing the data and doing exploratory data analysis - creating some graph and through these visualization we are giving high level of understanidng of nutrient content in the 
food items and summerizes the calorie and nutrient value at the end.
